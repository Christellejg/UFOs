# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this analysis was to create a webpage and table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript list. The webpage table has the ability to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The table can be filtered for the date, city, state, country, and shape.


## Results: 
Here is the webpage we help Dana design:

For someone who is new to this webpage, the process of using the search criteria is simple.One woud scroll down where it says "Filter Search" on the left panel. There you'll see where you can filter by date, city, state, country, and shape. FOr example, if you want to filter for UFO data for date: 1/8/2010, you would type "1/8/2010" in the date box and click "Filter Table" (shown below):

Once you've done that, all the UFO data dated on 1/8/2010 would populate, as shown below:

You will use these same steps if you are filtering by city, state, country, or shape.

## Summary: 
Drawback of this new design:
1. The wepage isn't that interactive. It simply a single paged webpage. There was no link to bring you deeper into the UFO data that a visiting user may have been interested in. 

Recommendations for further development:
1. It would be nice if the Filter Search had a "keyword" search, where visitors of the site, if they would like to read about a certain UFO but they only have a name or another information that is not a city, state, country, or shape. The keyword search can pull up any of the data that contains that keyword in it.
2. Making the webpage more interactive. Probably adding print document or email document to yourself options.
